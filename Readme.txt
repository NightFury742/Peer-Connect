Hello this is  Team Dankbyte!
We proudly present to you our submission for the open innovation challenge of HACKBYTE23
Our website is to be a forum exclusively for college students, where various colleges will be listed , and each college will have multiple tags of communities(some public and private).Public communities can be accessed by anyone , meanwhile private communities will require authorization from the Mod of the the particular college forum.
Initial idea is to connect IIITs together to open up room for great collaborations, but if the model is successful , we plan to bring this to every college in india. Students will be able to contribute to the source code as well.
